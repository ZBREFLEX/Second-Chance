        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide a safe, accessible, and collaborative platform that brings together individuals, counselors, NGOs, and communities to fight the growing problem of drug abuse. Through anonymous reporting, data-driven risk analysis, and real-time recovery support, we aim to save lives and build awareness.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          To create a society where early intervention, empathy, and support replace fear and stigma. We envision a future where technology bridges the gap between victims and help, giving everyone a second chance.
